A single Jupyter notebook delivers the whole contact-free fever-screening pipeline: it loads the public infrared-thermography dataset (≈1 k subjects with 33 facial + environmental features), applies nested cross-validation to avoid leakage, and engineers domain-aware signals such as inner-canthus focus, humidity, distance and demographic one-hots. After benchmarking classic learners, linear regression, random forest, a strong binning regressor—a 1-D CNN with L2 regularisation and dropout wins, cutting error to about 0.222 °C, well inside commercial IR-gun tolerances. One threshold (≥38 °C) instantly converts predictions to fever/not-fever, with a confusion matrix printed for sensitivity checks. A helper cell that returns both the temperature estimate and fever verdict.
